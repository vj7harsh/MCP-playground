# MCP Playground

A playground for experimenting with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standard for connecting tools, resources, and services to AI models through a consistent interface.  
This project is focused on learning, prototyping, and building the foundations of MCP-powered systems that can later scale into production-grade environments.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Understand and implement the **MCP specification** end-to-end.  
- Build a minimal **MCP server** and client integration.  
- Expose simple **resources** (e.g., system info, math utilities) and **tools** via MCP.  
- Explore integration with ML/AI models for inference pipelines.  
- Establish good engineering practices (Dockerized environment, CI/CD, tests, documentation).

## 📌 Scope
This project is not intended to be a production system (yet).  
Instead, the focus is on:
- **Learning**: gaining hands-on experience with MCP internals.  
- **Experimentation**: testing out connectors, tools, and resource schemas.  
- **Architecture exploration**: deciding how MCP servers, clients, and adapters fit into a larger system.  
- **Reusable templates**: creating boilerplate code and patterns that can be extended to real-world use cases.
